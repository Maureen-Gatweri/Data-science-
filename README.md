# Tuples
## Description of a tuple
A tuple is an ordered data structure that is used to store items of different data types.
Tuples are immutable,once declared cannot be modified.
Tuples can contain items of data types like Strings, Boolean and Integers.
Given the fact that tuples are immutable, it gives them an freedom to become dictionary keys because dictionary keys are immutable.

# Stacks
## Description of stacks
A stack is a data structure where the addition of a new element and removal of an existing element takes place at the same place which is at the top. 
Stacks use the LIFO FILO rule whereby the last item to be added is the first one to be removed and the first item to be added is the last one to be removed.
When you want to access an item which is at the middle, you'd have to remove all the items on top of it until you get to the required item.
- Stacks allow existence of duplicate values.

# Queues
## Description of queues
A queue is a data structure that is open on both ends and operations are performed in FIFO principle; that is First In First Out.
Ques also follow priority principle where one arranges elements in order of priority.
Ques also allow elements to be removed either from front or back.
Inserting and deleting items is smooth since queues follow the first in first out rule.
